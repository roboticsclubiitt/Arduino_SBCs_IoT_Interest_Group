# Servo-display
This system consists of a seven-segment display which is designed using the servos and IR sensor. 
Seven servos are connected to the Arduino that moves the 7-segment blades according to the input provided by the 
Arduino after motion detection.

Such a system can be used as people counter in events as it not only has an aesthetic value but practical value too.
