# Gesture controlled car

Won't it be fun to drive an RC car using your hand gestures? We tried to achieve the same by using an IMU connected to Arduino Nano to send commands to Arduino Nano on the bot, which is controlling the bot via the wifi module. Everything is powered via rechargeable Li-Ion batteries.

## Components:

- **Bot**: The RC car with all the control systems

- **Gesture recognising module**: held in hand or worn on the hand, which controls the bot.
