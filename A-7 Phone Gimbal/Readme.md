# Phone Gimbal

Stable videos and photos are liked by everyone, and gimbals help for the same, but commercial gimbals are very expensive, so why not make a cheap DIY alternative 
ourselves.

In this project, I made a gimble for my phone.


From the 3D CAD modelling and 3D printing of the parts to the code, everything was designed and implemented by me.

## Engineering Description:

This gimbal is a 2-axis gimbal, providing stability in roll and pitch.

Using MPU6050 IMU and Arduino nano, the changes in orientation are determined.

Using this determined change in orientation, a counter motion is generated using servo motors located at strategic locations in the setup.

Everything is powered by Li-ion batteries and is rechargeable too.
