## Engineering Description: 
The innovative three-wheel design of the car incorporates a unique steering mechanism, cleverly utilizing a pen cap in conjunction with a 9g servo to enable smooth and precise rotation of the steering wheel. The entire body and mechanical components were meticulously designed and crafted by our team, showcasing our engineering prowess. Powering the vehicle are two Li-Ion cells, ensuring optimal energy efficiency and performance. The car's intelligent control system is powered by an Arduino Uno, acting as the brains of the operation. Control instructions are seamlessly transmitted from a mobile application and received by the HC-05 Bluetooth module, allowing for convenient and intuitive remote operation. Our project represents a culmination of technical expertise, creativity, and problem-solving skills, resulting in a remarkable and cutting-edge vehicle.

This car also had a feature of detecting obstacles in front of it using IR-based proximity sensors, which, when sense some obstacle, stop the car, turn the steering to one of the extremes and reverses the car.
